✅ Final Replit Prompt: Kisyanga FC Website (React + Node.js)
🛠 Project Goal
Create a full-featured, responsive website for Kisyanga FC, a football club competing in Uganda’s Ntare Lions League. The website should highlight the club’s spirit, players, history, matches, and merchandise. This is both a hub for fans and a showcase for the club's legacy and future.

🔧 Tech Stack Requirements
Frontend:

ReactJS (use functional components only)

Tailwind CSS (preferred) or Bootstrap

Clean component structure with modular design

Backend:

Node.js + Express (set up basic API routes)

Use dummy JSON or mock database for dynamic sections (team, fixtures, news)

Deployment-ready on Replit

🌍 Club Background
Kisyanga FC was founded in 2006, coinciding with the Golden Jubilee of Ntare School — hence the nickname "Golden Bisya". Named after a beloved millet porridge that fueled many school nights, the club symbolizes brotherhood, resilience, and community.

We joined the Ntare Lions League in 2014, reaching the final in our debut season and clinching our first title soon after. We're now on a mission to reclaim glory while building a digital presence.

The Ntare Lions League is Uganda’s premier Sunday league for alumni of Ntare School, promoting camaraderie, fitness, and networking among Old Boys.
